# hello-world
a brand new start, an exploring try
hello, I am crazy about coding, especially cooperating with others all over the world on the Internet. I really appreciate that github, a great code repository platform, could give me a chance to realize my dreams. this is denefinity the first one project on github. So if there are any stupid mistakes that I have made, please be inclusiveÂ and tolerant. I believe i will learn fast and master it long before.
